Create a comprehensive nested hierarchical structure representing the shareholder distribution of [Entity Name] based on the available context.
Incorporate all shareholders from the provided data, even if the information is scattered across different sections.
Do not exclude any shareholder—ensure every available shareholder is captured and categorized correctly.
Structure the data hierarchically, grouping shareholders under relevant sections while preserving relationships.
Common sections may include but are not limited to:
Major Shareholders (or Substantial Shareholders)
Directors and Their Shareholdings
Top Holders of Fully Paid Ordinary Shares
Any other relevant sections present in the context
For each shareholder in any section, include:
Shareholder Name
Number of Shares Held
Percentage of Total Shares Held
If a section is not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred, include it to ensure completeness.
Strictly use only the data provided in the context. If a section or shareholder is missing from the data, do not invent information—simply omit it.
Ensure clarity in hierarchy and accuracy in representation, even if the data is dispersed.

Expected Output Format:
Parent Entity
├── Shareholder 1 - X shares (Y%)
│   ├── Sub-Shareholder 1.1 - A shares (B%)
│   │   ├── Sub-Shareholder 1.1.1 - C shares (D%)
│   │   └── Sub-Shareholder 1.1.2 - E shares (F%)
│   └── Sub-Shareholder 1.2 - M shares (N%)
